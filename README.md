# VexCodingStudioExtractor

As mentioned in the following thread, the Vex coding studio stores its files in a custom container with a .tar.gz compressed json file (named \_\_\_ThIsisATemPoRaRyFiLE___.json) with the program files base64 encoded inside a json object.

This program is designed to take in a vex coding studio file (or just the json file) and extract it to the original files for printing (not currently available in VCS), having multiple projects open at once (ALSO not currently available in VCS) or a VCS (vex needs a better name since this is confusing).
